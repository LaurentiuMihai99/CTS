RE-Invest:
The best web application regarding apartment rentals in Bucharest. The difficult part of the solution is done
using UiPath RPA Robots, development which isn't object oriented. The Web Application part is mostly for
the front-end, for the user interaction. Therefore, it only contains one class: Listing. This class contains
the required fields in order for the solution to work properly. Unfortunately, most concepts don't make sense
to be applied in my application due to the facts stated above, but I tried to make the best of what I have.

The Singleton method isn't useful in this case due to the way the application actually works,
but I am going to simulate the database connectivity as the use case for the Singleton.
 
Advantages:
- Only one instance of the database connection can be active at a time
- Allows for much easier tracking of query timestamps and handling of eventual timeouts
- Secure manipulation of timeouts (even though this still shouldn't be done from within the solution itself)

Disadvantages:
- In case the current connection breaks down, you cannot test the connection without firstly killing the current one
- Cannot benefit from multithreading advantages (mostly time)
