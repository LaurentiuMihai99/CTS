RE-Invest:
The best web application regarding apartment rentals in Bucharest. The difficult part of the solution is done
using UiPath RPA Robots, development which isn't object oriented. The Web Application part is mostly for
the front-end, for the user interaction. Therefore, it only contains one class: Listing. This class contains
the required fields in order for the solution to work properly. Unfortunately, most concepts don't make sense
to be applied in my application due to the facts stated above, but I tried to make the best of what I have.

The Factory method is useful when creating copies of listings which are going to be used within the scoring algorithms to
give a certain rating to the listings.

Advantages:
- Allows to add or remove listing objects at runtime
- Allows for quick and easy creation of objects without the need to specify all the fields and so on for every single object

Disadvantages:
- Can create confusion when used multiple times on the same object
- Can create changes in specific listings without the intent of doing so
