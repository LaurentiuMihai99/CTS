RE-Invest:
The best web application regarding apartment rentals in Bucharest. The difficult part of the solution is done
using UiPath RPA Robots, development which isn't object oriented. The Web Application part is mostly for
the front-end, for the user interaction. Therefore, it only contains one class: Listing. This class contains
the required fields in order for the solution to work properly. Unfortunately, most concepts don't make sense
to be applied in my application due to the facts stated above, but I tried to make the best of what I have.

The Builder pattern allows for quick and easy creation of objects without the need to specify all the fields of
a certain object at its creation, allowing for further customization using methods. In the Listings case it is useful for
handling the specs of an apartment in a listing. 
 
Advantages:
- Allows for easy customization of objects at it s creation without the need to manually address each field
- Previously written code remains pretty much up to date when using a Builder implementation (at least from a syntax POV)

Disadvantages:
- If not used accordingly, can cause problems (calling a certain method twice)
- Has to be kept up to date with every single new modification of the class it builds
