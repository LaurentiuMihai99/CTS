RE-Invest:
The best web application regarding apartment rentals in Bucharest. The difficult part of the solution is done
using UiPath RPA Robots, development which isn't object oriented. The Web Application part is mostly for
the front-end, for the user interaction. Therefore, it only contains one class: Listing. This class contains
the required fields in order for the solution to work properly. Unfortunately, most concepts don't make sense
to be applied in my application due to the facts stated above, but I tried to make the best of what I have.

The Factory method aims to solve the need to rewrite code when a change to the database format is made.
Given the fact that the database only contains one table and therefore only one object is used,
that object is heavily used throughout the solution.
 
Advantages:
- No need to rewrite previously written code in order to accomodate for table changes within the database
- No need to specify all attributes of a 'Listing' object every time you instatiate a new one

Disadvantages:
- Checks should be implemented when using certain fields of the 'Listing' objects since they are not neccesarily
going to have valid data within them
- Given the fact that all 'Listing' objects should come directly from the database, a factory is going to allow
another input method into the solution. If not handled accordingly, such input can influence the final
results
