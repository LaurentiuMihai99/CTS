Code Review

Stage 1. Naming conventions
	- Rename Clasa1 to something more meaningful
	- Rename Calculeaza - Use small caps
	- Rename the function arguments
	- Rename 'rezultat'
	- Rename 'valoare'
	
	- Format your code
	
	- Remove the hardcoded values aka "magic numbers"
	
	- Validate the input values
	- Replace if-then-else with Switch
	
Stage 2. KISS, Single Responsibility -> Reduce function complexity
	- Remove switch by using a generic approach for all product types
	- Outsource the validations
	- Outsource the way the fidelity discount is computed
	
Stage 3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
	- Remove the dependency regarding the validation of input fields
	- Remove the dependency on the static values (given by the Marketing team)
	- Remove the dependency on the way the fidelity is computed (decided by the Marketing team)
